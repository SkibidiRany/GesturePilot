# GesturePilot
We present GesturePilot, a real-time system that maneuvers a DJI Tello drone in 3D using hand gestures detected by a laptop/PC webcam via MediaPipe. To improve spatial awareness, we pipe the drone’s UDP video feed into OBS/VirtualCam so that an ORB-SLAM3 (Windows fork) process can treat it as a camera input and build a rough map. Weusethe SLAMoutputprimarily for security awareness (e.g., rotation verification and potential collision-prevention heuristics), while gesture commands are sent to the drone via the Tello SDK. We document the system design, Windows-specific build/run steps, gesture vocabulary and debouncing, and real-world constraints (battery, connectivity, Misclassifications). We also discuss our pivot from initial drowning-detection and selfie-drone ideas, the “single viewer” constraint on Tello streams, and engineering workarounds.
